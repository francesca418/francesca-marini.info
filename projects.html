            <h1 class="uni-class" style="font-size: 22px;"><u>LoReHLT 2019 Evaluation</u> | <a href="resources/lorelei.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a> </h1>
        <p>Low-Resource Human Language Technologies (LoReHLT) was a research competition run by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology" target="_blank">National Institute for Standards and Technology</a> (NIST), and our research team was funded by the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA" target="_blank">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a> (DARPA) and by a focused award from Google.</p>
        <p>This competition requires research teams to develop an NLP pipeline for <strong>low-resource languages</strong>, or languages that have very little available text data. 
          For example, if there were some kind of event (such as a natural disaster or political protest) in a remote region where a low-resource language is spoken, such a pipeline would allow first responders to know what is occurring in the region based on local news articles and Tweets without obtaining a translator, who might be difficult to find.</p>
          <p>I specifically worked on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition" target="_blank">Named Entity Recognition</a> (NER) team, which developed a system to identify proper names and locations in languages such as Ilocano and Odia.
          Our team achieved the highest scores in this competition.</p><br>
          <h1 class="uni-class" style="font-size: 22px;"><u>Non-Speaker Annotation for Low-Resource NER</u> | <a href="resources/low-resource.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a> </h1>

        <p>Building off of the LoReHLT 2019 project, we conducted a study in which non-native speakers of Indonesian, Russian, and Hindi annotated data for <strong>Named Entity Recognition</strong>, as a proof of concept. 
          For research projects like LoReHLT dealing with <strong>low-resource languages</strong>, the prevailing thought was that data annotation must be done by fluent speakers of the rare language. </p>
          <p>We demonstrated that non-native speakers of a language can annotate training data for NER which provides fairly strong model performance; 
          this means that there is less need to find fluent speakers  of such a language, which can be costly and time consuming. 
        </p><br>
        <h1 class="uni-class" style="font-size: 22px;"><u>Semantic Role Labeling for English Prepositions</u> </h1>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_role_labeling" target="_blank">Semantic Role Labeling</a> (SRL) is an NLP task which is focused on identifying arguments of a specific part of speech. Typically, this task focuses on verbs, but it can be applied to many parts of speech.
          One application for this type of NLP task is Event detection, which has applications in many fields, including security, public health and medicine, environmental sciences, and business. </p>
          <p>For an <strong>independent research project</strong> under the supervision of Professor Dan Roth, I have manually annotated a dataset and built a machine learning pipeline which performs both SRL and Sense Disambiguation classification on prepositions. 
          This is an ongoing research project which I have been working on now for almost a year.

            <p><a href="resources/MS Paper Final.pdf" target="_blank">An Explanation of the Gender Disparity in Multiple Sclerosis: Investigating the Genetic and Hormonal Bases for Increased Frequency of MS in Women</a> </p>
                <p>This paper was written for the class, Neurobiology of Brain Disorders. It was selected as an exemplary research paper to be used as an example for future students of the course. It presents a novel theory for why women are much more likely to develop MS than men by connecting several recent research findings.</p>
            <h1 class="uni-class" style="font-size: 22px;"><u>Argumentative Paper:</u></h1>
            <p><a href="resources/Abortion Paper.pdf" target="_blank">Response to Don Marquis' "Why Abortion is Immoral"</a></p>
            <p>This paper was written for a Philosophical Ethics course. It presents a critique of Don Marquis' "Why Abortion is Immoral", arguing that Marquis' logic is based on a flawed premise.</p>
            <h1 class="uni-class" style="font-size: 22px;"><u>Argumentative Paper:</u> </h1>
            <p><a href="resources/Utilitarianism Paper.pdf" target="_blank">In Support of Philippa Foot's "Utilitarianism and the Virtues"</a></p>
            <p>This paper was also written for the Ethics course. It defends an argument made by Philippa Foot against consequentialist ethical theories (such as Utilitarianism).</p>
